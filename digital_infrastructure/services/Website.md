# Website

Farset's main website (https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk) is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)-built static site hosted by [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) via it's own [repo](https://github.com/FarsetLabs/farsetlabs.github.io/).

Changes made in the `main` branch of that repository are automatically built by Github and if the build completes, the new site is pushed.
