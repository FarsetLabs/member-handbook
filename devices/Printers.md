This combined printer-scanner is available on the local network over bonjour, apple print, and samba, without any authentication requirements.

(Even though it's not technically a wifi printer, it's bridged onto the core network using an [AR11N-300](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07TND8849/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) )
