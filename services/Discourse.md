# Discourse

Discourse is our Forum platform, for longer term discussions and project documentation

It is running on an [Azure](../environments/Azure.md) VM

It previously ran as a [Bitnami](https://docs.bitnami.com/azure/apps/discourse/) stack, but that was poorly documented, unstable, and generally unmanagable

This service *could* be migrated to a Dockerised version but the resource requirements for running Discourse made running it in our [KitchenSync](../devices/KitchenSync.md) based [Docker](../services/Docker.md) environment infeasable.
