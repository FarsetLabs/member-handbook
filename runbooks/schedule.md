# Schedule of Tasks

This is a collection of Tasks that should be performed on a fixed/regular basis, either for the operation of the charity as an entity, the space as a resource, or the membership as a community.

These tasks include who is responsible for organising the completion of a task, not necessarily who has to do it.
