# Town Halls

## Purpose 

A Town Hall is a regular time for members of the hackerspace to get together and discuss any topics they feel are best raised in a somewhat official meeting, as well as providing a direct opportunity for wide visibility of the charities operations and engage on the management of the community for all.

Town Hall summaries intended for members (tl;dr where possible), and should be readable. Theyâ€™ll be read more frequently than written.

- Motions taken or rejected
- Voting and the outcome of the vote
- Actions taken or agreed to be taken

**NOTES**

* Town Halls are Timeboxed to a maximum of 2 hours.
  * It is the responsibility of the meeting chair to ensure discussion moves appropriatly within this constraint.
* Town Halls are 'Public'
  * Any individual from the wider Farset Labs community is welcome to contribute whether they are a current member or not, however, it is at the chairs' discretion how much time is allocated to discussions that are not primarily the concern of the operation of the charity or of the membership
* Town Halls are for discussion and decisions, not reading or teaching.
  * Agenda items and proposals should, where possible, be openly disseminated in advance of the meeting, so as to provide all attendees an opportunity to review/research any topics.

## Historical Notes

For the purposes of CCNI reporting, and since Town Halls operated in the same general capacity as classical AGMs, the Town Hall before the Charities Commission Reporting period date was generally selected to be the representative AGM - @bolster
