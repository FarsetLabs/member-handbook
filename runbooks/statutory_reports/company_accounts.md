# Annual Company Accounts

[Farset Labs' tresurer is required to submit statutory accounts to Companies House on an annual basis](https://www.gov.uk/annual-accounts)

Statutory accounts must include:

- A ‘balance sheet’, which shows the value of everything the company owns, owes and is owed on the last day of the financial year
- A ‘profit and loss account’, which shows the company’s sales, running costs and the profit or loss it has made over the financial year
- Notes about the accounts
- A director’s report

Our accounts are produced on the basis of Accruals (Charities SORP), and our Accountants (who also act as our independent examiners) are PKF-FPM.
