# Confirmation Statement

Every company, including dormant and non trading companies, must file a confirmation statement. It confirms the information that [Companies House](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/confirmation-statement-guidance) hold about your company is up to date.

Data that is included in this confirmation statement: 

* Company directors and secretary
* People with significant control (PSC)
* Company’s registered office address
* Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code
* Statement of capital
* Trading status of shares
* Exemption from keeping a PSC register
* Shareholder information

This confirmation must be filed at least annually, however, the 'clock' resets if any of these details need to be changed outside of that schedule (i.e. assignment / resignation of trustees)
