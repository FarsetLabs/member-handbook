# Runbooks

Runbooks are short, specific, documents related to how to accomplish, monitor or plan a given task or action. 

They are not 'policies', or strictly speaking official 'procedures', more being reminders and standard to record how we accomplish things in a consistent manner in line with out aims and objectives.

These have been structured into general areas related to the operation of the charity as a whole, ranging from how to off amazon from our credit line, or how to put the bins out.
