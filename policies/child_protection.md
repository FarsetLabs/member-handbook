## 1. Safeguarding policy statement

This document outlines the safeguarding policy and procedures for all work undertaken with children under the age of 18, and vulnerable adults at Farset Labs, in accordance with  the [Children Order (Northern Ireland) (1995)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisi/1995/755/contents/made), the [Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups (SVG) Act 2006]( https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/47/contents) and the [Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups (Northern Ireland) Order (SVG(NI)) 2007](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisi/2007/1351/contents) and incorporates their principles into its Child Protection Policy and Procedures.

   - The welfare of all children, young people and vulnerable adults is paramount
   - All children and vulnerable adults have the equal right to protection from abuse, neglect, exploitation and violence, as set out in the [United Nations Convention for the Rights of the Child 1989](https://www.unicef.org.uk/what-we-do/un-convention-child-rights/)

## 2.  Code of Conduct and behaviour

1. There are times when children, young people and vulnerable adults may be left at Farset Labs by their parents / carers to take part in workshops or activities organised by our staff. We follow strict recruitment practices to ensure skilled and experienced practitioners leading our sessions are safe and put the welfare of our participants first. We undertake AccessNI checks on all paid staff and regular volunteers. All activities involving children and vulnerable adults should be managed according to this code of conduct, with full risk assessments and risk management as standard.

1. All staff will be inducted on appointment and made aware of their responsibility and how to respond appropriately to incidents and disclosures

1. All staff will be trained and alerted to any changes in this Safeguarding Policy.

1. Volunteers will be inducted on appointment and made aware of their responsibility and how to respond appropriately to incidents and disclosures

1. Contractors will be asked to read summary sheets and sign an agreement to adhere to our safeguarding codes of conduct

1. There will be a copy of this policy (policy or/and summary sheet) on the front desk at all times

1. All staff will be trained to understand their individual responsibilities in relation to child protection and safeguarding.

1. We recognise that working in partnership with children, young people, their parents, carers and other agencies is essential in promoting young people’s welfare. The following code of conduct must be followed by all staff and volunteers
    - Staff should treat everyone, including all children and vulnerable adults, equally, with respect and dignity Staff should always put the physical and emotional welfare of each participant first, before achieving goals
    - Staff should not misuse their power over children Physical contact should be minimal, time limited and age appropriate Staff should not offer to transport children
    - Staff should not engage in personal communication with children, such as email or telephone or through social networking sites
    - Staff should aim to protect young people online, no staff must connect with children or young people on social media from their personal accounts. All social media activity for projects, events and exhibitions will be directed through official accounts. Create a protective and safe environment
    - Staff should work in partnership with children, young people and vulnerable adults to empower them in appropriate decision-making
    - Staff should give enthusiastic and constructive feedback, rather than negative criticism
    - Adults should avoid being left alone with a single child/vulnerable adult, and maintain professional behaviour at all times. Management arrangements should be designed to avoid this situation and all staff carry a responsibility for vigilance in this regard, other than in the case of an emergency
    - Staff should provide an atmosphere that is conducive to positive experiences for our patrons and participants

1. There are times when Farset Labs members may bring children, young people and vulnerable adults onto the premises as their guests.
    - Under no circumstances should children, young people or vulnerable adults be left unattended in the building. Farset Labs is a place of work and may contain tools, machinery and other hazards.
    - Under no circumstances should a Farset Labs member be left alone with the children at any time, unless they are the designated supervisor agreed in advance with their parent/carer. If we are unhappy at the level of supervision, inadequate facilities or if we feel our members are being mistreated or abused, Farset Labs will reserve the right to intervene and request that the parent or carer resumes supervision.

## 3.  Information for visiting groups

1. Farset Labs operates a Safeguarding Policy committing it to making sure children are protected and kept safe from harm while they are with the company. Farset Labs is also committed to ensuring that the rights of children, young people and adults at risk are respected and understood by its employees, including freelance artists, and volunteers.
1. As an organisation interested in or booked for a Farset Labs activity, the following outlines some additional information that relates specifically to Child Protection over and above practical arrangements for your visit.

1. What we expect from you
     - Farset Labs expects that most organisations will have a formal Child Protection Policy and Procedures. If you do not, we would encourage you to seek advice about developing a policy. Farset Labs will ask for a named contact and Child Protection Officer. These might not be the same people but we would ask you to consider the time of day or the date when you visit us (i.e. at least one of these people should be there when we are).
    - We will also ask about the number of children/young people and the number of adults who will be there. It is your responsibility to provide adequate supervision for your group for the full duration of the activity. Under no circumstances should a Farset Labs member of staff be left alone with the children at any time. If we are unhappy at the level of supervision, inadequate facilities or if we feel our staff are being mistreated or abused, Farset Labs will reserve the right to halt or cancel an activity.

1. What you can expect of us

- You can be assured that anyone from Farset Labs who visits your organisation has committed themselves to Farset Labs’ Safeguarding Policy. They will be trained professionals who understand how to work with young people and adults at risk and they will show you and your children/adults the respect you deserve. They will also have received our guidelines in recognising signs of abuse, reporting allegations and concerns and receiving disclosures. They will have also undergone an Enhanced Disclosure check by Access NI.

If at any point, you have a concern about the behaviour of one of our volunteers, contact Farset Labs’s Designated Safeguarding Lead, listed at the top of this document..
