# Articles of Association

> The full articles of association for the charity are 90% Companies House boiler plate, and the admin-editable document is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ncM55ymg2mu383W0bEDQUGdbQkaCwRt-KzA0WpQgFtc/edit) for any future adjustments to the Articles, and [here](articles_of_association.pdf) for a version suitable for accessory funding documentation.

> However, the Additional Provisions clause is the primary aspect of this document that is relevant to the operation of the charity, and is repeated here, as they fundamentally define the characteristics of the organisation.

> Changes to this document **will not mean anything**; changes to the articles can only be ratified at an AGM, and only then after receiving approval from the Charities Commission for Northern Ireland, can Companies House be informed of the change to the articles.
