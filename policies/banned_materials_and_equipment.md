# Banned Materials and Equipment

Most materials and equipment is allowed in Farset Labs. However, to protect the space and the safety of its members, members must not bring the following items onto Farset Labs property, or to Farset Labs events hosted elsewhere:

* Firearms, firearms components or ammunition;

* Explosives, explosive charges and related paraphernalia;

* Items listed in the [Offensive Weapons Act 2008](https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/offensive-weapons-knives-bladed-and-pointed-articles), except where used as tools;

* Items requiring a license to operate or carry, including some radio equipment;

* Large quantities of combustibles, inflammable liquids or pressurised gases;

* Equipment or materials likely to cause injury or harm;

* Materials or substances banned in the UK;

* Stolen materials or equipment.

Certain situations will allow normally disallowed materials & equipment to be brought to Farset Labs, for example custom components or dangerous chemicals needed for specialised processes. Farset Labs must be consulted before bringing any such items to the space, without exception.

## Specific regulations regarding chemicals:

**As a default position, no chemicals that have a hazard marking as per [Classification, Labelling and Packaging of Substances Regulation (CE) 1272/2008](https://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/13643/questions_and_answers_clp_20090526_en.pdf) or an equivalent system may be brought into Farset Labs. You are welcome to ask a member of the management team for permission to bring a chemical in, but you must first complete and submit a Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) form to [admin@farsetlabs.org.uk](mailto:admin@farsetlabs.org.uk).**

If your request is granted, it will likely be with a restriction on volume, usage, storage, and disposal - you must follow this and report any breaches or incidents immediately to a member of the management team. If the incident is serious, you must contact the relevant emergency service immediately, then make every available effort to inform a member of the management team in real-time, rather than leaving a message. 

Members engaging in any activity are solely responsible for considering the safety of all others in the space. This explicitly includes, but is not limited to, avoiding exposure to any and all hazardous chemicals, ensuring adequate ventilation for any process undertaken and clearly labelling and supervising any hazardous material and/or process while onsite and/or underway.

Provision of appropriate safety and personal protective equipment (PPE) is solely the member's responsibility. Where necessary the member must be prepared to give a full account of all chemicals and other hazards present to Farset Labs, Weavers Court management, PSNI, NIFRS, NIAS, NIHSE, and/or any other body with relevant authority.

At current, certain CLP hazard marked chemicals are permitted to be brought in the space by members. The list below indicates these (and is subject to change at any time by Farset management), along with the volume permitted IN TOTAL. In other words, all member stocks of the chemical MUST add up to less than or equal to the overall total specified. 

* Isopropyl alcohol 	-	one litre total

* WD-40 		- 	one litre total 

Each container of the chemical must be less than or equal to 500ml in capacity, be approved for storage of the chemical, and clearly marked in chemical-resistant ink with the member's contact details, the contents, and any CLP hazard marking symbols applicable. 

Members are responsible for the safe, legal and appropriate disposal of all used and/or unneeded wastes. You must inform the Farset Labs management team when you dispose of or finish the stock you have previously requested to use and/or keep in Farset Labs. Sensitising materials including - but not limited to - resins can be used onsite under certain limited conditions but never stored onsite when the member is not present.

At any time, Farset Labs reserves the right to revoke the permission to bring, use, or keep a chemical in the space. You must, within a reasonable timeframe to be decided by Farset Labs on a case by case basis, remove or dispose in an approved way of the chemical. Failure to do so may result in Farset Labs employing the services of a specialist company to safely remove any remaining stocks. You will be liable for any and all fees incurred in this process. By using any chemical in Farset Labs, whether hazardous or non-hazardous, approved by the Farset Labs management or un-approved, you agree to indemnify Farset Labs and its agents from any and all damages that may arise through your use of the chemical.
