## Policy Statement

Farset Labs take the safety of our members and visitors private digital information seriously. We do not use or trade our members’ / visitors’ contact information, event attendance, or any data transit activity for any marketing related or commercial purposes. In this document we outline what information we collect on our members and visitors, how we use it, the limited conditions when we may disclose it and how we keep that information secure.

## Types of Data We Collect

### Member Information

To keep in contact with our members we collect our members’ names, addresses, phone numbers, payment / subscriptions and other transactional information related to an individuals membership of Farset Labs, strictly for the purposes of being able to validate the membership status of individuals, and to contact said individuals for relevant important updates and related notifications. 

We will not discuss the membership status of individuals with any third parties unless is requested directly by external agencies in the process of detecting crime and in the prosecution of offenders.

### Donations, Subscriptions and Ticket Sales

When people use our website’s donate buttons or use our online ticketing software to buy tickets to Farset Labs we collect their name, address, email address, and phone number. We do not use this information in anything unconnected with completing that donation or sale and we do not sell or pass that information on to any third party.

We may use this information in a non-personal, aggregate form for impact reporting and usage monitoring

### Visiting groups with Children

As part of our [Safeguarding children policy](child_protection.md) when visiting groups are bringing children, Farset Labs maintains records of the named contact and Child Protection Officer of each group that visits. We do this to comply with UK law. If the event is photographed then we will keep records of the names and signatures of any consent forms that have been filled out by next of kin.
