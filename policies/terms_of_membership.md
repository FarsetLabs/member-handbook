## Membership 

Membership of Farset Labs gives you one vote in matters arising at any annual or extraordinary general meeting. This includes changes to the constitution, appointing or removing the charity trustees, and deciding whether the charity should be wound up. 

As a member you agree to adhere to these Terms of Membership and a serious breach of these terms will result in the termination of membership.

As a member you are granted permission to avail (where other considerations / inductions permit) the use of the space and facilities at our Unit 1 Weavers Court Business Park location. 

Termination of membership will result in withdrawal of permission to use or access the building. 

### Membership Dues

The membership due covers all costs associated with running the building, including: rent, electricity, heating, water, internet connectivity, public liability insurance (for common areas), legal fees, administration costs and general maintenance. There will be a review of membership fees annually to ensure that we are covering the costs of running the building.

Unless otherwise agreed by members, no members will receive a fee or discount to dues/desk rends for carrying out tasks related to the running of the building or charity.

### Fire Safety

- Members agree to adhere to all fire regulations as detailed in the Fire Safety Policy.
- Strictly no smoking or open flames anywhere in the building.
- Members and their guests must sign in/out of the building using the system provided. #todo this would be a bit change but given the shift in size of building might not be a bad idea...

### Security

- Members agree to adhere to all security protocols as detailed in the Induction 
- Members assume responsibility for the security of the building, and their property.
- No propping of the main door or other external doors, which must remain closed at all times.

### Noise

It is our responsibility to be good neighbours. The people living in the area are used to a quiet neighbourhood and we will do everything we can to ensure it stays that way.

- Please ensure that noise made cannot be heard outside the building. 
- Please ensure that you are quiet when entering and leaving the building. The gates can be very noisy!

Normal working hours are 9am to 5pm. Whilst it is reasonable to expect some level of noise during these hours, every effort must be made to reduce noise outside of that time.

## Respect

We aim to be good members of the local community, who are important stakeholders of the charity. 

Within our own community, we all need to strive towards cohesion and harmony. Therefore we expect our members to have respect for each other. We must listen and communicate with consideration for our fellow members. Please try to settle disputes amicably and be prepared to listen to the concerns other members might have. Think carefully about your fellow members' privacy, values, opinions and wellbeing.

The trustees will try and mediate disputes should that become necessary. 

## Culture and Ethos

 * Be Excellent to each other;
 * Don't disturb those who do not want to be disturbed;
 * If you see something and it doesn't look right or safe, it probably isn't so ask/tell someone about it;
 * [Intolerance will not be tolerated](equality.md).

## Handling of Complaints and Breaches

 * All members should endeavour to resolve minor personal issues directly with the persons involved;
 * If this is not possible, the following general approach is to be applied;
   * Raise a complaint to admin@farsetlabs.org.uk detailing the issue and the persons involved. Reports may be anonymously filed but this will slow the response, as the board will first have to corroborate the claims raised.
   * The issue trigger an Extraordinary Board meeting meeting and, at that boards discretion, directly with the persons involved.
   * After at most two weeks, a response will be issued by a member of the management board that may result in a warning or subsequent expulsion of those involved.
   * In the case of "minor infractions", a right to reply to the judgements of the board is permitted, and the board will respond to reasonable requests for explanation.
   * The board reserves the right to unilaterally and without any right to reply to permanently ban anyone who, through negligence or malice, endangers or risks endangering guests, members, the facility, or the charity.
