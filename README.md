# Farset Labs Member Handbook

This is a Markdown focused repository for documenting the technical operations of Farset Labs infrastructure, systems, and integrations. 

All documents should use relative linking.

It's entirely possible this will be torn down and imported into a proper wiki system, but :man_shrugging:

This is *not* a configuration management system, but is a handbook for operating and maintaining the digital infrastructure of the space/community

## Meta-Services

A 'Meta-service' is an internal definition for 'things that involve lots of services working together' that makes it slightly less confusing to document at a high level... 

This includes things like environmental monitoring.
